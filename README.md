# Capstone-3-Concrete

## Description
This capstone project is a simple CNN or Computer Vision project to classify concrete crack based on data from (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2) using Tensorflow.Keras. (its also my third time posting here)
The architure of this model is a simple CNN model consist of Convolutional layers and Pooling layers. Details will explained further.

## The process of how this model training been done

1. Import Packages
   - Import libraries that might be useful for this model (dunno la)

2. Data Loading
   - Load the given dataset from (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/2)
   - This is the code to load data from this website
